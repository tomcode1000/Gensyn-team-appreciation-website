To set up the required database tables, please follow these steps:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard at:
   https://app.supabase.com/project/pdhehczqtdszltszuudk

2. In the left sidebar, click on "SQL Editor"

3. Copy and paste the following SQL commands from the file 'supabase-migration.sql' into the editor:

);

-- Create votes table (if it doesn't exist)

  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  person_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  vote_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

-- Insert initial team members and moderators into votes table with 0 votes
-- Only insert if the person doesn't already exist

4. Click the "Run" button to execute the SQL commands

5. You should see success messages for each command

Note: 
- The "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" commands will create the tables if they don't exist
- The "INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS" commands will only insert records that don't already exist
- If you see any errors, they are likely because the tables/data already exist, which is fine

After running this migration, your Supabase database will be ready for the Gensyn Community Reviews Platform!
